# Academic Advising Software Tool

**Author**: Gilberto Arellano
**Student ID**: 1801074

## Overview

This project is an academic advising software tool designed to manage user data and facilitate academic advising processes. The application is divided into two main components: a backend and a frontend.

### Backend

The backend is built with TypeScript and uses Jest for testing and SonarQube to monitor code quality. It handles all the server-side logic, database interactions, and API services for CRUD operations on user data.

### Frontend

The frontend is developed using React with Next.js and styled with Shadcn/UI components. It provides an interactive user interface to perform operations like fetching, creating, editing, and deleting user data, reflecting changes made via API calls to the backend.

## Features

- **Database Management**: Manages a relational database schema to store user data effectively.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting user data through a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrates the frontend and backend through RESTful APIs to handle data operations dynamically.
